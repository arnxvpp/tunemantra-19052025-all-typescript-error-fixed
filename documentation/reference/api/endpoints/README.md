# TuneMantra API Endpoints Documentation

This directory contains specialized documentation about TuneMantra API endpoints.

## Contents

- [Historical API Endpoints Inventory](archive-endpoints-inventory.md) - Comprehensive listing of endpoints from previous development branches

## Purpose

The endpoints documentation provides deeper insights into specific API endpoints, including historical context, usage examples, and implementation details that complement the main API Reference.

## Historical Context

The [Historical API Endpoints Inventory](archive-endpoints-inventory.md) was created to preserve valuable information from the original `.archive/archived_misc_files/api_endpoints.md` file that was not properly incorporated into the comprehensive documentation.

This inventory provides:

1. A catalog of endpoints organized by branch and source file
2. Original endpoint paths, methods, and descriptions
3. Context about how the API evolved through different development branches

## Using This Documentation

This documentation is valuable for:

- Understanding the historical development of the TuneMantra API
- Researching previous API design patterns
- Finding legacy endpoints that may have been renamed or consolidated in the current API
- Maintaining backward compatibility with systems that might use older endpoints

For current API endpoints documentation, please refer to the [main API Reference](../api-reference.md).
