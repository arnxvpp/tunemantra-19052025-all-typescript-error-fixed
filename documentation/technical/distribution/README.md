# Music Distribution System Documentation

## Overview

The distribution system is the core component of TuneMantra, enabling artists and labels to distribute their music to major streaming platforms globally. This document provides technical details about the distribution architecture, components, and implementation.

## Distribution Architecture

TuneMantra's distribution system follows a microservice-based architecture with the following key components:

- **Distribution Service**: Manages the distribution process, including submission, delivery, and status tracking
- **Platform Adapters**: Specialized connectors for each streaming platform (Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music, etc.)
- **File Processing**: Handles music file validation, conversion, and preparation for distribution
- **Metadata Management**: Processes and validates release metadata according to platform requirements
- **Analytics Service**: Collects and processes streaming and download statistics

## Distribution Workflow

The typical distribution workflow includes the following steps:

1. **Content Submission**: Artists/labels upload music files and metadata
2. **Validation**: System validates files and metadata against platform requirements
3. **Distribution Processing**: Content is prepared and submitted to selected platforms
4. **Status Tracking**: System monitors the status of submissions across all platforms
5. **Reporting**: Performance data is collected and made available in the analytics dashboard

## Supported Platforms

TuneMantra supports distribution to the following platforms:

- Spotify
- Apple Music
- Amazon Music
- YouTube Music
- Deezer
- Tidal
- Pandora
- TikTok
- Instagram/Facebook
- And 150+ additional platforms

## Technical Implementation

The distribution system is implemented using the following technologies:

- **API Integration**: RESTful API connections to platform delivery endpoints
- **File Processing**: Advanced audio processing libraries for format conversion and quality control
- **Queuing System**: Asynchronous job processing for distribution tasks
- **Status Monitoring**: Automated polling and webhook receivers for status updates
- **Metadata Management**: JSON schema validation for platform-specific metadata requirements

## Configuration

Distribution service configuration is managed through environment variables and platform-specific configuration files located in the `config` directory.
