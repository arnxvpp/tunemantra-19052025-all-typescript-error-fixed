# Manual Distribution System

## Overview

While TuneMantra provides automated distribution to major digital service providers (DSPs), the Manual Distribution System addresses special cases, niche platforms, physical distribution, and custom delivery requirements that fall outside standard digital distribution channels. This system enables a human-in-the-loop approach for specialized distribution scenarios.

## Use Cases

### Platform Types for Manual Distribution

Manual distribution is typically utilized for:

- **Physical Media**: CD, vinyl, cassette, and other physical formats
- **Specialized Platforms**: Niche or genre-specific platforms without API integration
- **Emerging Markets**: Platforms in developing markets with custom submission requirements
- **Direct-to-Listener**: Direct distribution through artist websites or private platforms
- **Custom Retail**: Specialized retail arrangements with custom delivery requirements
- **B2B Licensing**: Business-to-business content licensing
- **Alternative Distribution**: Non-traditional distribution channels
- **Private Distribution**: Private or limited-access distribution

### Typical Scenarios

Common scenarios requiring manual distribution include:

1. **Vinyl Production**: Coordinating artwork, mastering, and manufacturing for vinyl releases
2. **Limited-Edition Physical Releases**: Special physical releases with custom packaging
