## System Overview

TuneMantra is a comprehensive multi-tenant platform for music distribution, rights management, and royalty processing. The system enables music labels, distributors, and independent artists to manage their catalog, distribute content to digital service providers (DSPs), track performance, and process royalty payments.

The platform is designed as a cloud-native application with a microservices architecture, enabling flexibility, scalability, and continuous delivery. It employs modern development practices including infrastructure-as-code, automated testing, and CI/CD pipelines.

## Architectural Principles

The TuneMantra architecture is guided by the following principles:

1. **Multi-tenancy** - All components support multiple organizations with strict data isolation
2. **API-First** - All functionality is exposed through well-defined APIs
3. **Cloud-Native** - Designed to leverage cloud services and patterns
4. **Microservices-Based** - Functionality is divided into independent, loosely-coupled services
5. **Scalability** - Components can scale independently based on demand
6. **Security-by-Design** - Security is integrated into all aspects of the architecture
7. **Observability** - Comprehensive monitoring, logging, and tracing
8. **Automation** - Infrastructure management and deployment are fully automated
9. **Data Integrity** - Strict data validation and consistency mechanisms
10. **Interoperability** - Extensive support for industry standards and integration patterns

## High-Level Architecture

The TuneMantra platform follows a layered architecture:

### Architectural Patterns

TuneMantra utilizes several architectural patterns:

1. **Microservices Architecture**: The system is composed of independent, loosely coupled services, each responsible for specific business functionality.

2. **API Gateway Pattern**: All client requests flow through a central gateway that handles cross-cutting concerns like authentication, routing, and rate limiting.

3. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Services communicate through events for asynchronous operations, improving decoupling and scalability.

4. **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**: For certain services, the system separates read and write operations to optimize performance.

5. **Repository Pattern**: Data access is abstracted behind repositories, providing a consistent interface to different data stores.

6. **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: The system includes mechanisms to handle failures in distributed service calls gracefully.

7. **Bulkhead Pattern**: Resources are isolated to prevent cascading failures across the system.
