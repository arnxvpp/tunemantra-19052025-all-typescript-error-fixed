## Introduction

This document describes the comprehensive security model implemented in the TuneMantra platform. It covers all aspects of security from architecture to operations, detailing the controls, processes, and technologies used to protect the platform, its users, and their data.

### Purpose and Scope

This document:

### Security Principles

TuneMantra's security model is built on these core principles:

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
2. **Least Privilege**: Minimal access rights for every user and component
3. **Secure by Design**: Security built into the architecture from the beginning
4. **Zero Trust**: Verification of all access requests regardless of source
5. **Data-Centric Security**: Protection focused on securing the data itself
6. **Privacy by Design**: Privacy controls built into all processes
7. **Continuous Improvement**: Ongoing enhancement of security measures

### Critical Assets Protection

The security model prioritizes protection of these critical assets:

1. **User Authentication Credentials**: Account access information
2. **Financial Data**: Royalty, payment, and banking information
3. **Intellectual Property**: Music content and associated rights
4. **Personal Information**: User and artist data
5. **Business Logic**: Proprietary algorithms and processes
6. **Configuration Data**: System settings and environment information
7. **Access Controls**: Permission and authorization information

## Security Architecture

The security architecture provides a structured approach to protecting all aspects of the platform through layered defenses.

### High-Level Security Architecture

The security architecture consists of these core layers:

1. **Perimeter Security**: Edge protection and external boundary controls

3. **Host Security**: Operating system and infrastructure protection
4. **Application Security**: Protection of application components
5. **Data Security**: Protection of data at rest, in use, and in transit
6. **Identity Security**: Authentication and authorization controls

### Security Domains

Security is implemented across these domains:

1. **User Domain**: End-user devices and access points
2. **Service Domain**: Application services and APIs
3. **Data Domain**: Storage systems and databases
