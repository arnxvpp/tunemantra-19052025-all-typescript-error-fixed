# TuneMantra Project Handover Document

## Project Overview

TuneMantra is a blockchain-powered music distribution platform that empowers artists through cutting-edge technological solutions and creative digital experiences.

### Core Components:
- TypeScript full-stack architecture (React/Node.js)
- Multi-network blockchain integration (Polygon Mumbai, Ethereum)
- Advanced metadata and rights tracking systems
- NFT-based content distribution mechanisms
- PostgreSQL-powered content management

## Documentation Status

The documentation for this project has been completely restructured and organized according to industry standards. All documentation is now properly categorized in the following directory structure:

- `documentation/` - Main documentation directory
  - `MASTER_INDEX.md` - Master index of all documentation
  - `TOPIC_DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md` - Topic-based documentation index
  - `SPLIT_DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md` - Index of split documentation files
  - `admin/` - Administration documentation
  - `user/` - User guides and documentation
  - `developer/` - Developer documentation
  - `technical/` - Technical documentation
  - `archive/` - Archived documentation
    - `sections/` - Documentation sections
      - `topics/` - Topic-based documentation files

The comprehensive documentation has been split into smaller, more manageable files to improve application performance.

## Recent Changes

- Split the large documentation file (8.9MB) into 17 smaller, topic-based files
- Created navigation systems with index files for the segmented documentation
- Corrected folder structure by moving "sections" folder to the archive directory
- Established proper directory structure for all topic-based files
- Removed unnecessary "sectioned" folder
- Updated all documentation references across index files
- Performed cleanup operations to prepare for project handover

## For Deployment Team

When you're ready to deploy the application to production, use the production cleanup script:

```bash
node scripts/production-cleanup.js
```

This script will:
- Remove development-only files and directories
- Remove source maps
- Install only production dependencies
- Reduce the overall package size

## Next Steps

1. **Application Testing**: The application should be thoroughly tested in a staging environment before deployment.
2. **Database Migration**: Ensure all database schemas are properly migrated.
3. **External Service Configuration**: Configure all external services and APIs.
4. **Blockchain Integration**: Test the blockchain integration with real networks.
5. **Security Audit**: Perform a security audit before going live.
