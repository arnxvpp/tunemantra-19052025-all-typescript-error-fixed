**Important**: The source code provided to you contains digital watermarks. These watermarks are unique to the copy of the code provided to you and serve as a security measure to protect our intellectual property. Here's what you need to know:

1. Each developer or team receives a uniquely watermarked version of the code
2. Watermarks are embedded throughout the codebase in various forms
3. Attempting to remove or alter watermarks is explicitly prohibited and constitutes a breach of your agreement
4. Watermarks do not affect functionality and should be preserved in all code you modify
5. If watermarked code appears in unauthorized locations, it can be traced back to its source

## Development Environment Setup

### Repository Access

You will be granted access to specific repositories based on your assigned modules. Please note:

1. Do not clone repositories to unsecured machines or public environments
2. Set up two-factor authentication for all repository access
