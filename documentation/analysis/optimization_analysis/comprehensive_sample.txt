### Implementation Recommendations

For guidance on implementing these features, refer to:
- [Implementation Recommendations](../.archive/implementation_recommendations.md) - Analysis of implementation priorities
- [Feature Catalog](../.archive/feature_catalog.md) - Comprehensive feature list
- [Feature Matrix](../.archive/feature_matrix.md) - Feature availability by branch

### Code Structure

Each feature directory contains:

- `frontend/`: UI components and client-side code
- `backend/`: Server-side implementation
- `shared/`: Shared types and utilities
- `docs/`: Documentation related to the feature
- `README.md`: Feature-specific documentation

### Integration Notes

When integrating these features:

1. Review the README in each feature directory for implementation details
2. Check for dependencies between features (e.g., Rights Management may depend on User Authentication)
3. Follow the phased implementation approach from the Implementation Recommendations
4. Ensure schema compatibility when integrating database models
