# TuneMantra Documentation Sections

This directory contains the TuneMantra comprehensive documentation split into manageable sections. This approach was implemented on March 30, 2025, to resolve performance issues with the original comprehensive documentation file (8.9MB), which was causing browser crashes and performance problems.

## Split Documentation Structure

Each section file contains a complete portion of the original comprehensive documentation, divided by logical topics. This approach provides several benefits:

- **Improved Performance**: Smaller files load faster and don't crash browsers
- **Better Navigation**: Targeted sections make it easier to find specific information
- **Reduced Resource Usage**: Lower memory consumption for better application performance
- **Maintained Completeness**: No content was lost during the split process

## File Size Distribution

The section files range in size from about 4KB to 2.1MB, with most files being under 1MB. This makes them much more browser-friendly than the original 8.9MB single file.

## Navigation

For a structured way to navigate through all documentation sections, use the [Split Documentation Index](../SPLIT_DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md).

## Implementation Details

These section files were created using a specialized documentation splitting script that preserved all internal links, formatting, and content hierarchy. The script is available at `scripts/utils/split_documentation.js`.
