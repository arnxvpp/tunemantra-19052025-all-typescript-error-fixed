#### Password Hashing Implementation

```typescript
// Hash a password for secure storage
export async function hashPassword(password: string): Promise<string> {
  // Generate a random salt
  const salt = randomBytes(16).toString('hex');

  // Hash the password with the salt using scrypt
  const hash = await scryptAsync(password, salt, 64);

  // Return the hash and salt combined as a single string
  return `${hash.toString('hex')}.${salt}`;
}

// Compare a supplied password with a stored hashed password
async function comparePasswords(supplied: string, stored: string): Promise<boolean> {
  // Handle multiple password formats

  // Format: "hashed.salt" (scrypt)
  if (stored.includes('.')) {
    const [hashedPassword, salt] = stored.split('.');
    const suppliedHash = await scryptAsync(supplied, salt, 64);
    return timingSafeEqual(
      Buffer.from(hashedPassword, 'hex'),
      suppliedHash
    );
  }

  // Format: "salt:hashed" (legacy)
  if (stored.includes(':')) {
    const [salt, hashedPassword] = stored.split(':');
    const suppliedHash = await scryptAsync(supplied, salt, 64);
    return timingSafeEqual(
      Buffer.from(hashedPassword, 'hex'),
      suppliedHash
    );
  }

  // Format: "$2b$..." (bcrypt)
  if (stored.startsWith('$2b$')) {
    return bcrypt.compare(supplied, stored);
  }

  // Unknown format
  return false;
}
```

#### Authentication Middleware

```typescript
// Authentication middleware for protected routes
export const requireAuth = (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
  // Check if user is authenticated via session
  if (!req.isAuthenticated() || !req.user) {
    return res.status(401).json({
      error: {
        message: 'Authentication required',
        code: 'AUTH_REQUIRED'
      }
    });
  }

  // Perform safety checks on the user object
  if (!req.user.id) {
    return res.status(401).json({
      error: {
        message: 'Invalid user session',
        code: 'INVALID_SESSION'
      }
    });
  }

  // Set userId for convenience in route handlers
  req.userId = req.user.id;

  // Enforce access restrictions based on account status
  if (req.user.status === 'suspended') {
    return res.status(403).json({
      error: {
        message: 'Your account has been suspended',
        code: 'ACCOUNT_SUSPENDED'
      }
    });
  }

  // Check if payment approval is pending
  if (req.user.status === 'pending_approval') {
    return res.status(402).json({
      error: {
        message: 'Your account is pending payment approval',
        code: 'PAYMENT_REQUIRED'
      }
    });
  }

  // Account is valid, proceed to the next middleware
  next();
};
```

#### API Rate Limiting Configuration

```typescript
// Configure rate limiting
const apiLimiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100, // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
  standardHeaders: true, // Return rate limit info in the `RateLimit-*` headers
  legacyHeaders: false, // Disable the `X-RateLimit-*` headers
  message: {
    error: {
      message: 'Too many requests, please try again later',
      code: 'RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED'
    }
  }
});

// Higher limits for authenticated users
const authenticatedLimiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 300, // higher limit for authenticated users
  standardHeaders: true,
  legacyHeaders: false,
  // Skip rate limiting for certain IPs or special users
  skip: (req, res) => req.user?.role === 'admin',
  message: {
    error: {
      message: 'Too many requests, please try again later',
      code: 'RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED'
    }
  }
});

// Apply rate limiting to routes
app.use('/api/', apiLimiter);
app.use('/api/auth/', authLimiter);
app.use('/api/users/', authenticatedLimiter);

### Using API Keys

To use an API key, include it in the request headers:

```
X-API-Key: tm_api_1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0j
```

Example with curl:

```bash
curl -H "X-API-Key: tm_api_1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0j" https://tunemantra.com/api/tracks
```

- **URL**: `/api/auth/token`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Content-Type**: `application/json`
- **Request Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "username": "string",
    "password": "string"
  }
  ```
- **Success Response**:
  - **Code**: 200 OK
  - **Content**: 
    ```json
    {
      "success": true,
      "data": {
        "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
        "expiresAt": "2025-03-26T09:15:30Z",
        "user": {
          "id": 123,
          "username": "artist_name",
          "name": "Artist Name",
          "role": "artist"
        }
      },
      "error": null,
      "meta": {}
    }
    ```

#### Using JWT Tokens

To use a JWT token, include it in the Authorization header with the Bearer scheme:

```
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

Example with curl:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..." https://tunemantra.com/api/tracks
```

### Security Considerations

#### Password Requirements

- Minimum 8 characters
- At least one uppercase letter
- At least one lowercase letter
- At least one number
- At least one special character

#### API Key Scopes

Available scopes for API keys:

- `track:read` - Read track data
- `track:write` - Create and update tracks
- `release:read` - Read release data
- `release:write` - Create and update releases
- `distribution:read` - Read distribution data
- `distribution:write` - Create and manage distributions
- `analytics:read` - Read analytics data
- `user:read` - Read user profile data
- `user:write` - Update user profile
- `royalty:read` - Read royalty data
- `payment:read` - Read payment data
- `payment:write` - Create payment requests

#### Rate Limiting

Authentication endpoints are rate-limited to prevent brute force attacks:

- 5 login attempts per minute per IP address
- 3 registration attempts per hour per IP address
- 3 password reset attempts per hour per user

#### Session Security

- Sessions expire after 30 days of inactivity
- Sessions are invalidated on password change
- Sessions can be remotely terminated by admins
