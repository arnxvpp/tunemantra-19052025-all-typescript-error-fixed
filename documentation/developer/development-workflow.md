   ```

### Local Services

The development environment includes:

- **Web Application**: http://localhost:3000
- **API Server**: http://localhost:3001
- **Database**: PostgreSQL running in Docker
- **Backend Services**: Accessible via API server

## Version Control Workflow

TuneMantra follows a Git Flow-based workflow with some customizations.

### Branch Structure

- **`main`**: Production-ready code
- **`develop`**: Integration branch for features
- **`feature/*`**: Feature development branches
- **`bugfix/*`**: Bug fix branches
- **`hotfix/*`**: Emergency fixes for production
- **`release/*`**: Release preparation branches

### Branch Naming Convention

Branches should follow this naming convention:

- `feature/TM-123-short-description`
- `bugfix/TM-456-issue-description`
- `hotfix/TM-789-critical-fix`
- `release/v3.2.1`

Where `TM-123` is the JIRA ticket number.

### Commit Message Format

Commit messages should follow this format:

```
[TM-123] Category: Short description (max 72 chars)

Longer description explaining the change in detail, if needed.
Reference any relevant tickets or issues.
```

Categories include:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Formatting changes
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or modifying tests
- `chore`: Build process or tooling changes

### Pull Request Process

1. Create a feature/bugfix branch from `develop`
2. Make changes and commit with proper format
3. Push branch to remote
4. Open pull request to `develop`
5. Assign reviewers
6. Address review comments
7. Merge when approved

## Development Process
