## Development Environment Setup

Follow these steps to set up your local development environment:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v20.x+)
- npm (v9.x+)
- PostgreSQL (v14+)
- Git
- VS Code (recommended) or preferred IDE

### Step-by-Step Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tunemantra/platform.git
   cd platform
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your local configuration
   ```

4. **Set up the database**
   ```bash
   # Create a PostgreSQL database
   createdb tunemantra
   
   # Push the schema to the database
   npm run db:push
   
   # Seed test data (optional)
   npm run db:seed
   ```

5. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Database Schema

The database schema is defined in `shared/schema.ts` using Drizzle ORM. Key entities include:

- **users**: User accounts and authentication
- **profiles**: User profile information
- **content**: Music tracks and releases
- **rights**: Rights and ownership information
- **royalties**: Royalty splits and payments
- **analytics**: Performance data and metrics

For a complete reference, see the [Database Schema Documentation](../technical/database-schema.md).

## API Reference

The API follows RESTful principles and is organized by resource type. All endpoints are defined in `server/routes.ts`.

Key API namespaces:
- `/api/auth/*`: Authentication endpoints
- `/api/users/*`: User management endpoints
- `/api/content/*`: Content management endpoints
- `/api/rights/*`: Rights management endpoints
- `/api/royalties/*`: Royalty management endpoints
- `/api/analytics/*`: Analytics endpoints

For a complete reference, see the [API Reference Documentation](../technical/api/api-reference.md).

## Frontend Architecture

The frontend is built with React and follows a component-based architecture:

- **Components**: Reusable UI elements
- **Pages**: Route-specific views
- **Hooks**: Shared stateful logic
- **Services**: API interaction logic

The application uses:
- **TanStack Query** for data fetching
- **Shadcn UI / Radix UI** for UI components
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **React Router** for routing

For details, see the [Frontend Implementation Documentation](../technical/frontend.md).

## Backend Architecture

The backend follows a service-oriented architecture:

- **Routes**: API endpoint definitions
- **Controllers**: Request handling logic
- **Services**: Business logic implementation
- **Storage**: Data access layer

The application uses:
- **Express** for the web server
- **Drizzle ORM** for database access
- **Passport.js** for authentication
- **Zod** for validation

For details, see the [Backend Implementation Documentation](../technical/backend.md).

## Common Development Workflows

### Adding a New Feature

1. Define the feature requirements
2. Update the database schema if needed
3. Create or update API endpoints
4. Implement backend business logic
5. Create frontend components
6. Add tests for the feature
7. Update documentation

### Making Database Changes

1. Update the schema in `shared/schema.ts`
2. Run `npm run db:push` to apply changes
3. Update affected API endpoints and services
4. Update type definitions and validation

### Deployment Process

The application uses a CI/CD pipeline for deployment:

1. Changes are pushed to the main branch
2. CI runs tests and builds the application
3. CD deploys to the staging environment
4. After verification, CD deploys to production

For details, see the [Deployment Guide](../technical/operations/deployment-guide.md).

## Key Design Patterns

The codebase follows several important design patterns:

1. **Repository Pattern**: Data access logic is abstracted behind interfaces
2. **Service Layer Pattern**: Business logic is encapsulated in service classes
3. **Controller Pattern**: Request handling is separate from business logic
4. **Factory Pattern**: Used for creating complex objects
5. **Observer Pattern**: Used for event handling
6. **Adapter Pattern**: Used for external service integration

## Testing Strategy

The testing approach includes:

1. **Unit Tests**: For individual functions and components
2. **Integration Tests**: For API endpoints and service interactions
3. **End-to-End Tests**: For complete user workflows

For details, see the [Testing Documentation](testing.md).

## Security Considerations

The application implements several security measures:

1. **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication
2. **Authorization**: Role-based access control
3. **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated with Zod
4. **CSRF Protection**: Cross-site request forgery protection
5. **XSS Prevention**: Content security policy and output encoding
6. **Rate Limiting**: Protection against brute force attacks

For details, see the [Security Documentation](../technical/security.md).

## Advanced Features

### AI Metadata Enhancement

The AI system processes audio files to extract and enhance metadata. It uses machine learning models for:

- Genre classification
- Mood detection
- Similar artist identification
- Audio fingerprinting

For details, see the [AI Metadata Enhancement Documentation](../technical/services/ai-metadata-enhancement.md).

### Blockchain Rights Verification

The blockchain integration provides immutable rights verification through:

- Smart contracts for rights registration
- Transaction recording for rights transfers
- Hash verification for content identity

For details, see the [Blockchain Integration Documentation](../technical/services/blockchain-integration.md).

### Multi-tenant Architecture

The multi-tenant system allows multiple labels to operate on a single platform instance with:

- Data isolation between tenants
- Tenant-specific customization
- Hierarchical tenant relationships

For details, see the [Multi-tenant System Documentation](../technical/platforms/multi-tenant-system.md).

## Known Issues and Limitations

Be aware of these current limitations:

1. **Performance with Large Catalogs**: Performance degradation with extremely large catalogs (100,000+ tracks)
2. **Mobile Feature Parity**: The mobile application has a subset of web features
3. **Reporting Export Formats**: Limited export formats for some report types
4. **Integration Throughput**: Rate limits with some external services
5. **Offline Capabilities**: Limited offline functionality

## Future Development Roadmap

The platform roadmap includes:

1. **Enhanced AI Features**: Expanded AI capabilities for content analysis
2. **Blockchain Expansion**: More comprehensive blockchain integration
3. **Advanced Analytics**: Deeper performance insights and forecasting
4. **Mobile Application Enhancements**: Feature parity with the web version
5. **Integration Expansion**: Additional platform integrations
