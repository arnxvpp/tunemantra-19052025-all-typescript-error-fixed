## Introduction

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the TuneMantra platform. It provides guidelines for ensuring software quality through various testing methods and approaches.

### Purpose

The purpose of this testing strategy is to:

1. Define a consistent approach to testing across the platform
2. Establish quality standards for all components
3. Document testing practices and responsibilities
4. Provide a framework for test automation
5. Ensure comprehensive test coverage

### Scope

This strategy applies to all aspects of the TuneMantra platform:

- Frontend web application
- Backend API services
- Database operations
- Integration with external services
- DevOps processes
- Security mechanisms

## Testing Principles

TuneMantra's testing approach is guided by these core principles:

1. **Shift Left**: Testing begins early in the development cycle
2. **Test Pyramid**: Higher volume of unit tests, fewer integration tests, fewer UI tests
3. **Automation First**: Automated testing prioritized over manual testing
4. **Risk-Based**: More thorough testing for high-risk areas
5. **Continuous Testing**: Tests integrated into CI/CD pipeline
6. **Quality Ownership**: Developers responsible for code quality and tests
7. **Maintainability**: Tests treated as production code with same quality standards
8. **Traceability**: Tests linked to requirements and user stories

## Test Types

### Unit Testing

**Purpose**: Verify individual functions and components work as expected in isolation.

**Approach**:
- Test each function, method, or component independently
- Mock external dependencies
- Focus on edge cases and error conditions
- Aim for high code coverage

**Examples**:
- Testing a utility function that calculates royalty splits
- Testing a React component renders correctly with different props
- Testing a validation function handles various input scenarios

### Integration Testing

**Purpose**: Verify that components work together correctly.

**Approach**:
- Test interactions between components
- Verify API contracts between services
- Test database operations
- Minimal mocking, more real dependencies

**Examples**:
- Testing API endpoints with database interaction
- Testing component interactions in the frontend
- Testing service-to-service communication

### End-to-End Testing

**Purpose**: Verify complete user workflows function correctly.

**Approach**:
- Test full user journeys
- Use a browser automation tool
- Test across different browsers and devices
- Focus on critical user paths

**Examples**:
- Testing the user registration and login flow
- Testing the content upload and distribution process
- Testing the royalty calculation and statement generation

### API Testing

**Purpose**: Verify API endpoints function correctly.

**Approach**:
- Test request/response formats
- Verify authentication and authorization
- Test error handling
- Performance testing for key endpoints

**Examples**:
- Testing REST API endpoints for correct responses
- Testing API error responses for invalid inputs
- Testing API rate limiting functionality

### UI Testing

**Purpose**: Verify user interface components render and function correctly.

**Approach**:
- Test component rendering
- Test user interactions
- Test responsive behaviors
- Visual regression testing

**Examples**:
- Testing form validation and submission
- Testing navigation components
- Testing modal dialogs and popovers
- Testing responsive layouts

### Acceptance Testing

**Purpose**: Verify the system meets business requirements.

**Approach**:
- Test based on acceptance criteria
- Focus on business value
- Involve product owners in verification
- Use Gherkin syntax for behavior-driven development

**Examples**:
- Testing that users can successfully distribute content to platforms
- Testing that royalty calculations match expected values
- Testing that analytics dashboards show correct data

- Integration test coverage measured separately
- Coverage reports generated in CI pipeline
- Coverage trends tracked over time

### Critical Paths

The following areas require 100% test coverage:

1. Authentication and authorization
2. Financial calculations (royalties, payments)
3. Rights management logic
4. Data export functionality
5. User permission checks

## Testing Process

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)

For critical components, TDD approach is encouraged:

1. Write a failing test that defines expected behavior
2. Implement minimal code to make the test pass
3. Refactor code while maintaining passing tests
4. Repeat for additional functionality

### Testing During Development

1. **Planning Phase**:
   - Define acceptance criteria
   - Design test approach
   - Identify test cases

2. **Development Phase**:
   - Write unit tests concurrently with code
   - Run tests locally before committing
   - Fix failing tests immediately

3. **Code Review Phase**:
   - Review test coverage
   - Verify test quality
   - Ensure edge cases are tested

4. **Integration Phase**:
   - Run integration tests
   - Verify component interactions
   - Test with realistic data

### Regression Testing

- Automated regression test suite runs in CI/CD pipeline
- Full regression testing before each release
- Critical path regression tests run on every PR

### Bug Fix Testing

1. Create a failing test that reproduces the bug
2. Fix the code to make the test pass
3. Ensure the fix doesn't break other functionality
4. Add regression test to prevent recurrence

## Test Environments
