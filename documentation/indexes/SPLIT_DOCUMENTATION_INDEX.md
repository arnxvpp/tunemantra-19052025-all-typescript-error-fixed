# TuneMantra: Split Documentation Index

This document serves as the main index for the split version of the comprehensive documentation. 
The original large file (TuneMantra_Comprehensive_Documentation.md) has been split into smaller, 
more manageable sections to prevent browser crashes and improve usability.

## Documentation Sections

Each section can be accessed individually for better performance:

- [Introduction](sections/00_Introduction.md)
- [Section 1: Project Overview](sections/01_Project_Overview.md)
- [Section 2: System Architecture](sections/02_System_Architecture.md)
- [Section 3: Blockchain Technology](sections/03_Blockchain_Technology.md)
- [Section 4: Rights Management](sections/04_Rights_Management.md)
- [Section 5: Database Schema](sections/05_Database_Schema.md)
- [Section 6: API Reference](sections/06_API_Reference.md)
- [Section 7: User Guides](sections/07_User_Guides.md)
- [Section 8: Administration](sections/08_Administration.md)
- [Section 9: Development](sections/09_Development.md)
- [Section 10: Integrations](sections/10_Integrations.md)
- [Section 11: Analytics & Reporting](sections/11_Analytics___Reporting.md)

## Note on the Original Documentation

The original comprehensive documentation file (`TuneMantra_Comprehensive_Documentation.md`) is still 
maintained but may be too large to load effectively in browsers. This split version provides the same
content in a more accessible format.

## Updating Documentation

When updating documentation:

1. Make changes to the appropriate section file
2. Update cross-references as needed
