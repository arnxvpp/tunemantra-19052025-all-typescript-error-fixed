# Index of Root-Level Documentation Files

This document provides an index of all documentation files that were originally located at the root level of the repository and have been moved into the documentation structure.

## Project Documentation

These files have been moved to the `documentation/project/` directory:

| Original Location | New Location |
|-------------------|--------------|
| `/codebase-comparison.md` | `/documentation/project/codebase-comparison.md` |
| `/comprehensive-code-evolution.md` | `/documentation/project/comprehensive-code-evolution.md` |
| `/implementation-plan.md` | `/documentation/project/implementation-plan.md` |

## Testing Documentation

These files have been moved to the `documentation/testing/` directory:

| Original Location | New Location |
|-------------------|--------------|
| `/testing-approach.md` | `/documentation/testing/testing-approach.md` |
| `/testing-guide.md` | `/documentation/testing/testing-guide.md` |
| `/test-plan.md` | `/documentation/testing/test-plan.md` |

## Documentation Structure

These files have been moved to the `documentation/metadata/` directory:

| Original Location | New Location |
|-------------------|--------------|
| `/documentation-structure.md` | `/documentation/metadata/documentation-structure.md` |
| `/documentation-updated-structure.md` | `/documentation/metadata/documentation-updated-structure.md` |

## Documentation Index Files

These files provide navigation for the documentation systems:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `/documentation/MASTER_INDEX.md` | Master index for all documentation systems |
| `/documentation/TOPIC_DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md` | Index for topic-based documentation (newest) |
| `/documentation/SPLIT_DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md` | Index for sectioned documentation (deprecated) |

## Retained Files

These files remain at the root level:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `/README.md` | Main project README with overview and navigation |
| `/TuneMantra_Documentation_Links.md` | Links to important documentation |
| `/TuneMantra_Documentation_Reference.md` | Reference for documentation structure |

## Note on Implementation

All files have been moved from their original locations to their new homes in the documentation structure. The main documentation README has been updated to reference the new locations.

The original comprehensive documentation has been split into smaller topic files for better performance, accessible through the TOPIC_DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md file.

This organization helps maintain a clean, well-structured documentation system that is easier to navigate and maintain.
