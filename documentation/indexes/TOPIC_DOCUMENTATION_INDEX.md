# TuneMantra: Topic-Based Documentation Index

This document serves as the main index for the topic-based version of the comprehensive documentation. 
The original large file (TuneMantra_Comprehensive_Documentation.md) has been split into smaller, 
more manageable topic files to prevent browser crashes and improve usability.

## Documentation Topics

Each topic can be accessed individually for better performance:

- [Introduction](archive/sections/topics/00_Introduction.md)
- [Topic 1: Project Overview](archive/sections/topics/01_Project_Overview.md)
- [Topic 2: System Architecture](archive/sections/topics/02_System_Architecture.md)
- [Topic 3: Blockchain Technology](archive/sections/topics/03_Blockchain_Technology.md)
- [Topic 4: Rights Management](archive/sections/topics/04_Rights_Management.md)
- [Topic 5: Database Schema](archive/sections/topics/05_Database_Schema.md)
- [Topic 6: API Reference](archive/sections/topics/06_API_Reference.md)
- [Topic 7: User Guides](archive/sections/topics/07_User_Guides.md)
- [Topic 8: Administration](archive/sections/topics/08_Administration.md)
- [Topic 9: Development](archive/sections/topics/09_Development.md)
- [Topic 10: Integrations](archive/sections/topics/10_Integrations.md)
- [Topic 11: Analytics & Reporting](archive/sections/topics/11_Analytics___Reporting.md)
- [Topic 12: Distribution Systems](archive/sections/topics/12_Distribution_Systems.md)
- [Topic 13: AI & Machine Learning](archive/sections/topics/13_AI___Machine_Learning.md)
- [Topic 14: Security](archive/sections/topics/14_Security.md)
- [Topic 15: Testing & Quality Assurance](archive/sections/topics/15_Testing___Quality_Assurance.md)
- [Topic 16: Additional Documentation](archive/sections/topics/16_Additional_Documentation.md)

## Note on the Archived Documentation

Both the original comprehensive documentation file (`TuneMantra_Comprehensive_Documentation.md`) and the sections folder (containing the topic-based files) 
have been moved to the `documentation/archive` folder for storage purposes. The comprehensive documentation file may be too large 
to load effectively in browsers, which is why it was split into smaller topic files that provide the same content in a more 
accessible format.

## Performance Benefits

The topic-based documentation provides these advantages:

- **Better Performance**: Files are 4KB to 2.1MB instead of 8.9MB
- **Faster Loading**: Each topic loads quickly without browser lag
- **Focused Reading**: Find exactly what you need without scrolling through unrelated content
- **Less Memory Usage**: Reduces browser crashes during documentation browsing

## Updating Documentation

When updating documentation:

1. Make changes to the appropriate topic file
2. Update cross-references as needed
