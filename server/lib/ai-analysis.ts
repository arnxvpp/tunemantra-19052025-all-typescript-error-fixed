/**
 * AI Content Analysis Module: Music and Video Smart Tagging
 * 
 * üéµ What This Module Does:
 * -----------------------
 * This module is like having a music expert who listens to your songs and tells you what 
 * genre they are, what mood they create, and what they're about - all automatically!
 * 
 * When artists upload a new song or video, this system:
 * 1. Looks at the title and artist name
 * 2. Uses artificial intelligence to figure out information about the content
 * 3. Creates tags and categories that help people find the content later
 * 
 * üß† How It Works For Beginners:
 * ----------------------------
 * 
 * 1. üè∑Ô∏è Automatic Content Tagging
 *    - Without AI: Artists would have to manually tag each song with genres, moods, etc.
 *    - With AI: The system automatically suggests these tags based on just the title and artist
 *    - Example: "Summer Nights" by "Beach Boys" might be tagged as [genre: "pop", mood: "happy", 
 *      theme: "summer", language: "english"]
 * 
 * 2. ü§ñ AI Integration (Using OpenAI)
 *    - We connect to OpenAI's powerful AI models through their API (a way computers talk to each other)
 *    - We send them basic information about the song or video
 *    - They analyze it and send back detailed information about what it might contain
 *    - This happens in seconds, saving hours of manual work!
 * 
 * 3. üõ°Ô∏è Reliable Fallbacks
 *    - If the AI service is unavailable, the system has backup data to use
 *    - This ensures the application keeps working even if there's a problem with the AI
 *    - Users never see an error or broken experience
 * 
 * 4. üîç What Kind of Information It Provides:
 *    - Genres: What style of music (pop, rock, hip-hop, etc.)
 *    - Moods: How it makes listeners feel (happy, sad, energetic, etc.)
 *    - Themes: What topics it covers (love, friendship, social issues, etc.)
 *    - Languages: What languages are used in the content
 *    - Content Warnings: If there might be explicit or sensitive content
 *    - Quality Analysis: Suggestions for improving the content
 * 
 * üí° Why This Matters:
 *    - Helps users discover content they'll love based on their preferences
 *    - Makes content searchable by specific attributes
 *    - Improves recommendations across the platform
 *    - Saves artists time in describing their own content
