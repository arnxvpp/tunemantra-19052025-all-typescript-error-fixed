/**
 * Distribution Job Processor: Automated Music Delivery System
 * 
 * üéµ What This Module Does:
 * -----------------------
 * This is the "delivery truck" of the music platform! It handles the complete automated process
 * of sending your music to streaming platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, and others.
 * 
 * When an artist or label wants to distribute their music, this system:
 * 1. Queues up the distribution jobs based on platform selections
 * 2. Processes them in the background automatically (no manual intervention needed)
 * 3. Tracks the status of each distribution across all platforms
 * 4. Handles retries and error recovery if something fails
 * 5. Provides real-time status updates to the user interface
 * 
 * üöö Real-World Examples:
 * -------------------
 * Imagine you're an artist who has just uploaded a new album:
 * 
 * 1. You select platforms where you want your music to appear (e.g., Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal)
 * 2. You choose a release date (immediate or scheduled for future)
 * 3. You click "Distribute"
 * 
 * Behind the scenes, this system:
 * - Creates distribution jobs for each selected platform
 * - Packages and delivers all your music files and metadata to each platform
 * - Transforms your content into each platform's required format
 * - Checks with each platform periodically to see when your music is live
 * - Updates your dashboard with success/failure statuses
 * - Retrieves platform-specific links and IDs for your released content
 * 
 * üîÑ Complete Distribution Workflow:
 * -------------------------------
 * 1. Job Creation Phase:
 *    - System receives distribution request from user
 *    - Creates separate jobs for each selected platform
 *    - Validates all required metadata and files
 *    - Assigns job priority and scheduling information
 * 
 * 2. Scheduled Releases:
 *    - System checks every 30 seconds for upcoming scheduled releases
 *    - When release date arrives, scheduled jobs are moved to active queue
 *    - Release dates are respected exactly - no early or late deliveries
 *    - Time zone considerations are handled automatically
 * 
 * 3. Processing Queue:
 *    - Active jobs are processed as soon as capacity is available
 *    - System maintains rate limits for each platform
 *    - Prioritizes jobs based on subscription level and urgency
 *    - Balances load to prevent platform-specific bottlenecks
 * 
 * 4. Content Preparation:
 *    - Source files are prepared according to platform requirements
 *    - Metadata is formatted per each platform's specifications
 *    - Content warnings and territory restrictions are applied
 *    - Digital signatures and checksums verify file integrity
 * 
 * 5. Delivery Execution:
 *    - Content is delivered via each platform's preferred method:
 *      * API calls for modern platforms (Spotify, Apple Music)
 *      * SFTP uploads for legacy systems
 *      * XML/DDEX feeds for aggregators
 *    - Delivery receipts and confirmation IDs are captured
 * 
 * 6. Status Monitoring:
 *    - After submission, system regularly checks platform status
 *    - Updates job status (pending ‚Üí processing ‚Üí completed/failed)
 *    - Retrieves platform-specific links and IDs once live
 *    - Captures QA information and any platform-side warnings
 * 
 * 7. Error Handling:
 *    - Automatic retry system for temporary failures
 *    - Exponential backoff to handle platform rate limits
 *    - Detailed error categorization for troubleshooting
 *    - Critical errors trigger notifications for manual review
 * 
 * 8. Notification System:
 *    - Artists/labels receive updates on distribution progress
 *    - Success notifications include platform-specific links
 *    - Failure notifications include specific error details
 *    - Pre-release reminders for scheduled distributions
 * 
 * üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation:
 * -------------------------
 * The system uses a robust background processing architecture:
 * - Background processing loop runs every 30 seconds
 * - Concurrent processing allows up to 3 distributions simultaneously
 * - Priority queuing ensures premium users get faster processing
 * - Rate limiting prevents platform API overloading
 * - Temporary directories isolate file preparation for security
 * - Transaction-based processing ensures no partial distributions
 * - Comprehensive logging provides audit trail and debugging
 * - Statistics tracking monitors system health and performance
 * 
 * üìä Platform-Specific Considerations:
 * ---------------------------------
 * - Each platform has unique requirements for:
 *   * File formats (WAV, FLAC, MP3 quality levels)
 *   * Image specifications (dimensions, color profiles)
 *   * Metadata fields (some platforms require extra fields)
 *   * Publishing information and royalty splits
 *   * Processing times (varies from hours to weeks)
 * 
 * - The system handles these differences transparently
 * - Users don't need to know each platform's technical requirements
 * - All content is automatically optimized for each destination

   * Distribution Job Processor Initialization

   * üöÄ What This Constructor Does:

   * When the TuneMantra platform starts up, this constructor initializes

   * 
   * 1. Creates a safe, isolated workspace (temporary directory) for processing
   *    audio files, artwork, and metadata before sending to platforms
   * 
   * 2. Launches the automated background processing system that continuously
   *    checks for new music to distribute and updates on existing distributions
   * 
   * This is similar to starting up a delivery service - setting up the warehouse,
   * preparing the delivery trucks, and establishing the scheduling system all at once.
   * 
   * From an artist's perspective, this ensures that:
   * - Their music is processed securely without risking other artists' content
   * - Releases they schedule for future dates will be delivered automatically
   * - Status updates will be continuously monitored without manual intervention
   * 
   * The system is completely autonomous once started, requiring no additional
   * intervention to handle the continuous flow of music distribution.

   * Background Processing Loop - The Heart of Automated Distribution
   * 
   * üîÑ What This Method Does:
   * -----------------------
   * This method creates the continuous "heartbeat" of the music distribution system.
   * It's like setting up an automated factory line that never stops running.
   * 
   * In practical terms, it:
   * 
   * 1. Creates a continuous timer that wakes up every 30 seconds to check:
   *    - If any scheduled releases are due for distribution today
   *    - If any new distributions have been requested
   *    - If any in-progress distributions have been completed or failed
   * 
   * 2. Processes jobs immediately on startup so users don't have to wait for
   *    the first timer interval to pass before their music starts distributing
   * 
   * From an artist's perspective, this ensures:
   * - Music submitted at 11:59pm will still be processed overnight
   * - Scheduled releases for future dates will automatically distribute
   *   even if no one is actively using the system
   * - Status updates appear continuously throughout the distribution process
   * 
   * Technical considerations:
   * - The 30-second interval balances responsiveness with system efficiency
   * - Too frequent = excessive database load and potential API rate limits
   * - Too infrequent = delayed processing and poor user experience
   * - No sleep() or blocking operations that could freeze the entire system
   * 
   * This autonomous loop runs 24/7 as long as the application is online,
   * ensuring reliable music delivery without manual intervention.

   * 2. Pick up any pending distributions and process them
   * 3. Check if any in-progress distributions have completed or failed
   * 
   * The method is designed to be resilient, with safety checks to prevent:
   * - Multiple processing cycles running at once (via the isProcessing flag)
   * - Too many concurrent jobs overwhelming the system or hitting API rate limits
   * - Crashes from affecting the entire distribution system
   * 
   * Each processing cycle is self-contained, making the system robust against errors.

   * Check Platform Status for Music Distribution
   * 
   * üîç What This Method Does:
   * -----------------------
   * This is the method that "calls home" to music platforms to check on your music.
   * It's like tracking a package delivery, but for your songs! It answers questions like:
   * 
   * - "Is my album live on Spotify yet?"
   * - "Why was my release rejected by Apple Music?"
   * - "How much longer until fans can hear my music?"
   * 
   * For each distribution, it connects to platforms (like Spotify, Apple Music, etc.)
   * to check if a release that we've sent them is:
   * 
   * 1. Successfully published and available to listeners (SUCCESS!)
   * 2. Still being processed by the platform (WAIT...)
   * 3. Rejected due to an error in the submission (FAILED)
   * 
   * Technical details:
   * -----------------
   * - Makes API requests to distribution platforms using their authentication tokens
   * - Handles different response formats from each platform's unique API
   * - Implements exponential backoff for API rate limiting
   * - Extracts standardized status information from varied platform responses
   * - Provides detailed error information when distributions fail
   * 
   * From an artist's perspective:
   * --------------------------
   * This powers the "Track Distribution Status" feature artists see on their
   * dashboard. When they click "Refresh Status," this method is what goes out
   * to check if their music is live yet, and returns:
   * 
   * - Direct links to where their music is now available
   * - Specific error messages if something went wrong
   * - Estimated time to completion if still processing
   * 
   * This is critical for artists who are promoting their releases on social media
   * and need to know when they can share links with their fans.
   * 
   * @param record - The distribution record to check status for
   * @returns A status object containing:
   *          - isComplete: Whether the distribution is finished successfully
   *          - hasFailed: Whether the distribution has failed
   *          - platformReleaseId: The platform's unique ID for the release (for links)
   *          - platformUrl: A direct URL where fans can find the music
   *          - errorDetails: Specifics about what went wrong if it failed

   * - When it was delivered
   * - If it arrived successfully or ran into problems
   * - Links to where fans can find it once it's live
   * 
   * In practical terms, it creates a complete history of all your music's distribution 
   * across platforms by:
   * 
   * 1. Getting the most recent distribution attempts first (like newest mail on top)
   * 2. Including status information (was it delivered, rejected, or still in transit?)
   * 3. Providing context (what song/album, which platform, who's the artist)
   * 4. Including direct links to where successful music is live on platforms
   * 5. Showing specific error messages explaining why any distributions failed
   * 
   * For artists and labels:
   * --------------------
   * This powers the "Recent Activity" feed in your dashboard, making it easy to:
   * - Track what's happening with all your music across platforms
   * - Find links to share with fans when releases go live
   * - Identify and fix problems with failed distributions
   * - See which platforms process your music fastest
   * 
   * For platform administrators:
   * -------------------------
   * This provides a monitoring system to:
   * - Check which platforms might be experiencing technical issues
   * - See distribution volume and success rates across the system
   * - Identify trends in distribution failures
   * - Monitor overall platform health and performance

  /**
   * Platform Distribution Health Report
   * 
   * üìä What This Method Does:
   * -----------------------
   * This method is like a "wellness check" for your music distribution across all
   * streaming platforms. Think of it as a diagnostic report that shows which platforms
   * are healthy and which ones might need attention.
   * 
   * In practical terms, it:
   * 
   * 1. Gathers data from every platform you distribute to (Spotify, Apple Music, etc.)
   * 2. Counts exactly how many releases you've sent to each platform
   * 3. Measures success rates (what percentage of your music made it through)
   * 4. Flags any platforms with unusual failure rates that need attention
   * 5. Shows which platforms are most popular among your artists
   * 6. Calculates the average processing time for each platform
   * 
   * For platform administrators:
   * -------------------------
   * This powers the "Platform Health Dashboard" that helps you:
   * - Spot technical problems before they affect many artists
   * - Monitor which platforms process music fastest
   * - Identify patterns in distribution failures
   * - Track platform popularity to guide partnership priorities
   * - See overall system health at a glance
   * 
   * For artists and labels:
   * --------------------
   * This helps you make informed decisions about:
   * - Which platforms deliver your music most reliably
   * - Where your music gets processed fastest
   * - Which platforms deserve priority in your release strategy
   * 
   * Real-world example:
   * ----------------
   * If this report shows that Spotify has a 99% success rate while a smaller platform
   * only has a 75% success rate, platform administrators would know to investigate
   * technical issues with that smaller platform's integration, and artists might 
   * choose to submit to Spotify several days before the smaller platform to ensure
   * on-time release.
   * 
   * Technical implementation:
   * ----------------------
   * - Queries multiple database tables (platforms, distribution records)
   * - Performs aggregate calculations (counts, percentages)
   * - Uses Promise.all for concurrent processing of all platforms
   * - Returns a sorted array for easy identification of priority platforms
   * 
   * @returns An array of platform statistics objects containing:
   *          - platformId: The unique identifier for each platform
   *          - platformName: Human-readable name (e.g., "Spotify", "Apple Music")
   *          - totalDistributions: Count of all releases sent to this platform
   *          - successfulDistributions: Count of releases successfully delivered
   *          - failedDistributions: Count of releases that failed processing
   *          - pendingDistributions: Count of releases still in progress
   *          - successRate: Percentage of successful distributions (0-100)
