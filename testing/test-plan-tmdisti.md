### 5.1 Functional Testing

*   **Unit Testing:**
    *   **Responsibility:** Developers
    *   **Frontend (React):** Use Jest/Vitest and React Testing Library. Focus: Individual components, hooks, state management logic, utility functions. Coverage Goal: 80%.
    *   **Backend (Node.js):** Use Jest/Vitest or Mocha/Chai. Focus: Individual modules, controllers, services, database interactions (mocked), utility functions. Coverage Goal: 80%.
    *   **Execution:** Run locally during development and automatically in CI pipeline on every commit.
*   **API Testing:**
    *   **Responsibility:** QA Engineers, Developers (for new endpoints)
    *   **Tools:** Postman (manual exploration), Newman/Supertest/Axios (automated tests).
    *   **Focus:** Validate endpoint contracts (request/response schemas via Zod/similar), CRUD operations, authentication/authorization, error handling (4xx/5xx status codes), parameter validation, business logic correctness.
    *   **Execution:** Manual exploration during development; Automated suite run in CI pipeline against deployed backend in QA/Staging.
*   **Integration Testing:**
    *   **Responsibility:** QA Engineers, Developers
    *   **Focus:** Verify interactions between components.
        *   *Frontend-Backend:* Test data flow from UI interactions to API calls and back using tools like MSW (Mock Service Worker) or by testing against a live backend.
        *   *Backend-Database:* Test service layer interactions with the actual database (PostgreSQL/Drizzle) in a controlled test environment (e.g., using Testcontainers or a dedicated test DB). Verify data persistence, retrieval, schema correctness, and transactions.
        *   *Service-to-Service:* Test interactions between the Node.js backend and Internal Auth API / Stripe API. Use mocked responses for automated tests; test against sandbox/staging environments for dedicated integration test cycles.
    *   **Execution:** Automated tests run in CI pipeline; Manual verification in QA/Staging.
*   **End-to-End (E2E) Testing:**
    *   **Responsibility:** QA Engineers
    *   **Tools:** Cypress or Playwright.
    *   **Focus:** Simulate real user scenarios traversing the entire application stack (UI -> API -> DB -> UI). Prioritize critical user flows (Registration, Login, Music Upload/Distribution, Payment).
    *   **Execution:** Automated suite run against the fully deployed application in the QA/Staging environment, typically less frequently than unit/integration tests (e.g., nightly or pre-release).

### 5.2 UI/UX Testing

*   **Responsibility:** QA Engineers, Designers (review)
*   **Cross-Browser/Device Compatibility:**
    *   **Targets:** Latest stable versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari on Desktop; Chrome (Android) & Safari (iOS) on representative Mobile/Tablet viewports/emulators.
    *   **Method:** Manual testing, potentially using cloud platforms (BrowserStack/Sauce Labs) for wider coverage if needed. Check layout rendering, styling consistency, and core functionality.
*   **Usability Checks:**
    *   **Method:** Heuristic evaluation against established usability principles (Nielsen's Heuristics). Informal walkthroughs with internal stakeholders or target user proxies. Focus on task flow efficiency, navigation clarity, information architecture, and error prevention/recovery.
*   **Accessibility Validation:**
    *   **Standard:** WCAG 2.1 Level AA.
    *   **Method:** Combination of automated tools (Axe DevTools, WAVE), manual keyboard navigation testing, screen reader testing (NVDA, VoiceOver, JAWS), color contrast analysis, zoom testing.
*   **Visual Consistency Verification:**
    *   **Method:** Manual comparison against Figma mockups. Focus on adherence to design system components, layout, typography, color palette, spacing, and imagery. Consider automated visual regression testing tools (Percy, Applitools) integrated into the CI pipeline for key pages/components to catch unintended visual changes.

### 5.3 Backend Testing

*   **Responsibility:** Developers, QA Engineers
*   **Database Integrity:** Verify Drizzle schema migrations apply correctly, data types, constraints (foreign keys, unique constraints), indexes, and default values are enforced. Test data validation logic within the database layer if applicable.
*   **API Functionality:** Covered extensively under API Testing (Section 5.1). Ensure all business rules are correctly implemented and enforced at the API layer.
*   **Error Handling:** Test backend resilience to invalid inputs, unexpected conditions (e.g., database connection failure, external API timeouts), and malformed requests. Verify appropriate logging and user-friendly (non-revealing) error messages/status codes are returned.
*   **Security Checks:** Covered under Security Testing (Section 5.5). Focus specifically on backend vulnerabilities: secure handling of credentials, session management, protection against injection attacks, proper authorization checks at the API level.

### 5.4 Integration Testing (Detailed Scenarios)

*   **User Onboarding:** React Registration Form submission -> Node API validation -> Call to Internal Auth API for user creation -> Node API receives confirmation -> Postgres User Record creation -> React Login screen redirection.
*   **Music Upload & Processing:** React Upload Component interaction -> File upload to storage (e.g., S3/local via Node API) -> Node API receives metadata -> Metadata validation -> Postgres Metadata Record creation/update -> Background processing job trigger (if any).
*   **Distribution Submission & Payment:** React Distribution Form submission -> Node API validation -> Call to Stripe API to create Payment Intent -> React Stripe Elements handles payment -> Stripe Webhook confirmation received by Node API -> Node API updates distribution status in Postgres -> Confirmation displayed in React UI.
*   **Royalty Data Display:** React Dashboard component mount -> Node API request for royalty data -> Node API service queries Postgres (potentially complex joins/aggregations) -> Node API formats response -> React component renders charts/tables.

### 5.5 Non-Functional Testing

*   **Responsibility:** QA Engineers (potentially specialized performance/security testers)
*   **Performance/Load Testing:**
    *   **Tools:** k6, JMeter, Grafana (for monitoring).
    *   **Environment:** Dedicated performance testing environment mirroring production specs and data volume as closely as possible.
    *   **Scenarios:** Simulate 100 concurrent users executing a mix of critical actions (Login, Browse, Upload initiation, Distribution submission). Ramp-up, sustained load, and stress tests.
    *   **Metrics:** Average/95th/99th percentile response times (<500ms target), error rates (<1%), throughput (requests/sec), server resource utilization (CPU, RAM, Disk I/O, Network). Identify bottlenecks.
*   **Security Testing:**
    *   **Tools:** OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite (Community/Pro), `npm audit`/`yarn audit`, Snyk/dependabot.
    *   **Checks:**
        *   *Automated Scans:* Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) using ZAP/Burp against QA/Staging. Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools if available. Dependency scanning in CI.
        *   *Manual Checks:* Focus on OWASP Top 10: Injection (SQLi, NoSQLi, XSS), Broken Authentication/Session Management, Sensitive Data Exposure, XML External Entities (XXE), Broken Access Control, Security Misconfiguration, Insecure Deserialization, Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities, Insufficient Logging & Monitoring. Test key authentication, authorization, and data handling endpoints. Basic penetration testing concepts.

### 5.6 Regression Testing

*   **Responsibility:** QA Engineers, Automated CI Pipeline
*   **Strategy:** Prevent previously fixed defects from recurring and ensure new changes haven't broken existing functionality.
*   **Scope:**
    *   *Automated:* Execute a curated suite of automated tests (Unit, API, critical Integration & E2E flows) on every merge to main/release branches within the CI pipeline.
    *   *Manual:* Risk-based manual testing focusing on the changed module, directly impacted areas, and historically problematic features before a release.
*   **Suite Management:** Regularly review and update the automated regression suite to keep it relevant, fast, and reliable.

## 6. Test Environment(s) & Data Management

*   **Environments:**
    *   **Development:** Local machines (Dockerized services recommended for consistency). Unit tests, linting, local debugging.
    *   **CI:** Ephemeral environment for running automated checks (Unit, API, Integration).
    *   **Staging/QA:** Stable, long-lived environment mirroring production infrastructure. Deployed via CI/CD. Used for most QA activities (Manual, E2E, Performance, Security). Integrated with sandbox/staging external services (Auth API, Stripe).
    *   **Performance:** Dedicated environment, potentially scaled-down production replica, specifically for load testing. Needs isolated database and potentially external service mocks/stubs.
    *   **Production:** Live environment. Post-deployment smoke tests only.
*   **Test Data Management:**
    *   **Strategy:** Use a combination of database seeding scripts (via Drizzle or custom scripts), data generation libraries (e.g., Faker.js), and potentially anonymized production data subsets (if feasible and compliant).
    *   **Data Sets:** Maintain distinct data sets for different scenarios (e.g., new users, users with large catalogs, users with payment issues, specific edge cases).
    *   **Isolation:** Ensure tests clean up after themselves or run in isolated containers/databases where possible to avoid data conflicts between tests.
    *   **Credentials:** Use secure methods for managing test credentials for external services (e.g., environment variables, secrets management tools). Use Stripe's test mode keys and cards exclusively.
    *   **Privacy:** Strictly adhere to data privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) when handling any user-like data, even in test environments. Anonymization is key if using production-derived data.

## 7. Automation Strategy

*   **Goals:** Increase test coverage, improve feedback loop speed, ensure regression safety, free up QA for exploratory and complex testing.
*   **Priority Areas for Automation:**
    1.  Unit Tests (Dev responsibility, highest priority)
    2.  API Tests (QA/Dev, high priority)
    3.  Backend Integration Tests (QA/Dev, high priority)
    4.  CI/CD Pipeline Checks (Linting, Unit, API, Integration - critical)
    5.  Critical Path E2E Tests (QA, medium/high priority)
    6.  Regression Suite (Composed of above automated tests)
    7.  Dependency Security Scans (CI, medium priority)
    8.  Basic DAST Scans (CI/Nightly, medium priority)
    9.  Visual Regression Tests (Optional/CI, medium priority)
    10. Accessibility Scans (Automated portion - CI, medium priority)
*   **Tools Selection:** (As listed in previous sections - Jest/Vitest, Cypress/Playwright, Postman/Newman, k6, ZAP, Axe, etc.)
*   **Framework:** Develop reusable testing utilities, page objects (for E2E), and clear reporting mechanisms. Store automated test code in the project repository alongside application code.

## 8. Defect Management & Reporting Process

*   **Tool:** Jira, Azure DevOps Boards, GitHub Issues, or similar designated tool.
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  **Discovery:** Defect identified during any testing activity (manual or automated failure analysis).
    2.  **Logging:** Create a detailed bug report including:
        *   Clear, concise title.
        *   Steps to reproduce (numbered).
        *   Expected Result.
        *   Actual Result.
        *   Severity (e.g., Critical, High, Medium, Low - defined criteria needed).
        *   Priority (Determined by Product Owner/Team).
        *   Environment(s) where observed.
        *   Screenshots, Videos, Logs (as applicable).
        *   Build/Version number.
        *   Labels/Components.
    3.  **Triage:** Regular meeting (e.g., daily/bi-weekly) with QA, Dev Lead, Product Owner to review new defects, assign severity/priority, and plan resolution.
    4.  **Assignment:** Defect assigned to the appropriate developer/team.
    5.  **Resolution:** Developer fixes the code, performs unit tests, merges changes.
    6.  **Verification:** QA Engineer re-tests the specific fix on a new build in the designated environment (usually QA/Staging). Also performs regression testing around the fix.
    7.  **Closure/Re-opening:** Close the defect if the fix is verified and no regressions are found. Re-open with comments if the issue persists or the fix causes new problems.
*   **Reporting:**
    *   **Dashboards:** Utilize defect tracking tool dashboards for real-time visibility (e.g., open bugs by severity, bug trends).
    *   **Test Cycle Reports:** Summarize execution status, pass/fail rates, new defects found, open critical defects after each major test cycle.
    *   **Test Summary Report:** Final report at the end of the release testing phase, detailing overall quality, coverage achieved, outstanding risks, and go/no-go recommendation.
