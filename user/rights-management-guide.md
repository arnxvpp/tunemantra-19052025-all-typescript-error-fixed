## Frequently Asked Questions

### Rights Basics

**Q: What's the difference between master rights and publishing rights?**  
A: Master rights (sound recording copyright) cover the specific recorded version of a song and are typically owned by the recording artist or their label. Publishing rights (composition copyright) cover the underlying musical composition (melody, lyrics, structure) and are typically owned by songwriters and their publishers. Both generate different revenue streams and require separate management within TuneMantra.

**Q: How do I determine who owns what percentage of a song?**  
A: Ownership percentages should be agreed upon by all contributors before or during the creation process. TuneMantra's Split Management tools allow you to document these agreements. Generally, percentages are based on:
- Contribution significance to the final work
- Prior agreements between collaborators
- Industry standards for specific roles (e.g., producer points)
- Written contracts specifying ownership division

The most important principle is having clear written documentation of all splits that totals exactly 100%.

**Q: Why do I need to register my works with collection societies if I'm already distributing through TuneMantra?**  
A: Distribution platforms only collect certain types of royalties (primarily streaming and download revenue). Collection societies collect performance royalties when your music is:
- Played on radio, TV, or in public venues
- Used in films, commercials, or other media
- Performed live
- Streamed on certain platforms that pay performance royalties separately

Without society registration, you're likely missing significant revenue streams that distribution alone doesn't capture.

### Platform-Specific Questions

**Q: How do I handle rights for a song that uses samples?**  
A: For sampled content, TuneMantra provides specialized documentation tools:
1. Use the Sample Documentation section to record all samples used
2. Upload sample clearance documentation for each sample
3. Configure "sample split" percentages to allocate ownership to original creators
4. Link the sample source works in your rights documentation
5. Ensure all sample permissions are properly documented before distribution

Uncleared samples can result in takedowns, legal issues, and financial penalties, so always secure and document proper clearance.

**Q: Can TuneMantra help resolve a rights dispute with another creator?**  
A: Yes, TuneMantra offers several conflict resolution tools:
1. Conflict Documentation: Upload evidence supporting your ownership claim
2. Mediation Interface: Communicate with other parties in a structured environment
3. Split Proposal Tools: Suggest and negotiate resolution splits
4. Resolution Templates: Use standard industry resolution approaches
5. Agreement Generation: Create and execute formal resolution documentation

For disputes requiring legal intervention, TuneMantra can provide case documentation and specialized support, though external legal counsel may be necessary for court proceedings.

**Q: How do I transfer rights to another party using TuneMantra?**  
A: To transfer rights:
1. Navigate to Rights Management > Transfer Rights
2. Select the works to transfer (individual works or catalog bundles)
3. Specify transfer type (full assignment, partial transfer, license, etc.)
4. Define territories and term
5. Set effective date and payment terms
6. Generate transfer documentation
7. Complete electronic signature process with receiving party
8. Submit registration updates to relevant societies and platforms

The system will automatically update ownership records and redirect future royalties according to the transfer terms.
