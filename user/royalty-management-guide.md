## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Royalty Questions

**Q: How are streaming royalties calculated in TuneMantra?**  
A: TuneMantra calculates streaming royalties using a multi-step process:
1. We collect stream counts and revenue data from each platform (Spotify, Apple Music, etc.)
2. For each platform, we apply the appropriate rate structures:
   - Pro-rata share of revenue pools for major platforms
   - Per-stream rates for platforms using fixed rate models
   - Custom formulas for specialized platforms
3. We apply territory-specific adjustments based on where streams occurred
4. The system then applies your specific splits to determine each participant's share
5. Results are aggregated across all platforms and displayed in your royalty dashboard

For detailed platform-specific calculations, you can view the "Calculation Method" tab in the royalty detail view for any earning period.

**Q: When are royalties processed and paid?**  
A: The royalty processing and payment schedule works as follows:
1. Data Collection: Platform data is typically received 30-60 days after the end of each month
2. Processing: Royalties are calculated within 10 business days of receiving complete platform data
3. Statement Generation: Statements are published by the 15th of each month for the period two months prior
4. Payment Processing:
   - Monthly payment option: Payments processed by the 20th of each month
   - Quarterly payment option: Payments processed by the 20th of the month following quarter end
   - Payment receipt typically occurs 3-5 business days after processing, depending on your payment method
   - Minimum payment thresholds apply (configurable in your account settings)

You can view your processing schedule and payment history in the Payments section of your dashboard.

**Q: How do I handle royalty splits for tracks with multiple contributors?**  
A: TuneMantra offers several tools for managing complex splits:
1. Split Manager: The visual split editor allows precise percentage allocation
2. Split Templates: Create and save common split configurations for quick application
3. Split Agreement Generator: Create formal documentation of split arrangements
4. Bulk Split Application: Apply consistent splits across multiple tracks
5. Split Groups: Manage internal splits within collectives or groups
6. Split History: Track changes and maintain a record of all split modifications
