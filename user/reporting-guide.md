A: Data refresh schedules vary by data source:
- Streaming data: Updated daily with 24-48 hour lag from platforms
- Financial data: Updated as statements are processed (typically monthly)
- Audience data: Refreshed weekly for most platforms
- Rights data: Updated in real-time as changes occur
- Custom metrics: Calculated during report generation

You can view the data freshness for any report in the report header, which displays the last data update timestamp. For critical time-sensitive analysis, you can trigger a manual data refresh from the report actions menu.

**Q: Can I combine data from multiple sources in a single report?**  
A: Yes, TuneMantra offers several methods for multi-source reporting:
1. The Custom Report Builder allows joining data across compatible sources
2. Cross-source templates are available for common multi-source needs
3. Data Blend functionality lets you combine results from separate queries
4. The Data Integration layer pre-combines certain compatible data sources

When building cross-source reports, pay attention to the "Relationship" panel to ensure proper data mapping between sources. Our Cross-Source Analysis Guide provides detailed instructions for complex multi-source reporting needs.

### Technical Questions

**Q: What are the export limits for reports?**  
A: Export limits vary by format and subscription level:
- PDF exports: Up to 500 pages per report
- Excel exports: Up to 1 million rows
- CSV exports: Up to 5 million rows
- Scheduled exports: Up to 20 reports per schedule
- API data extraction: Rate limits based on your subscription tier

For extremely large data extracts, we recommend using the Data Export API with pagination, or scheduling segmented reports. Enterprise users can request temporary limit increases for special reporting needs by contacting support.

**Q: How can I automate the distribution of reports to my team?**  
A: TuneMantra offers comprehensive report automation options:
1. Email Scheduling: Configure reports to be delivered via email on a recurring schedule
2. Shared Folders: Set up auto-updating reports in team workspaces
3. API Integration: Use our reporting API to pull reports into other systems
4. Webhook Triggers: Configure event-based report generation
5. Portal Subscriptions: Let team members subscribe to report updates

The most popular approach is to use the Schedule Manager (Reports > Schedules) to create a delivery schedule, select recipients, and configure delivery options including format preferences and message customization.

**Q: How do I troubleshoot a slow-running report?**  
A: If you encounter performance issues, try these troubleshooting steps:
1. Check data volume: Reports with large date ranges or high granularity will be slower
2. Examine filters: Add filters to reduce the dataset being processed
3. Review calculations: Complex calculated fields can impact performance
4. Consider aggregation: Pre-aggregate data when detailed records aren't necessary
5. Check visualizations: Some visualization types are more resource-intensive
6. Inspect parameters: Certain parameter selections may expand the data scope

For persistent performance issues, the Performance Analyzer tool (available in the report editor) can identify specific bottlenecks. The system will also provide optimization suggestions for improving report efficiency.

### Report Design

**Q: What's the best way to visualize trend data over time?**  
A: For time-based trend visualization, consider these options:
1. Line charts: Best for continuous data showing precise changes over time
2. Area charts: Effective for showing cumulative values or part-to-whole changes
3. Column charts: Good for discrete time periods with precise value comparison
4. Candlestick charts: Ideal for showing range data (high/low/open/close)
5. Heatmaps: Excellent for showing intensity patterns across time and categories

For most music industry metrics, line charts with appropriate annotation are the most effective. When comparing multiple trends, limit to 3-5 lines with distinct colors and include a clear legend. Use interactive tooltips to provide precise values at specific points in time.

**Q: How can I create reports that are optimized for both desktop and mobile viewing?**  
A: To create truly responsive reports:
1. Use the "Responsive Design" toggle in the report builder
2. Select mobile-friendly visualizations (simpler charts work better)
3. Configure "Mobile Layout" separately from desktop layout
4. Use "Progressive Disclosure" to hide details until requested
5. Test your report using the Mobile Preview function
6. Set up alternative views for different device types

The "Mobile First" templates in the template gallery are specifically designed with responsive principles in mind. For critical mobile reports, consider creating a dedicated mobile version rather than adapting a desktop report.

**Q: What's the best approach for comparing performance across different time periods?**  
A: Effective period-over-period comparison can be achieved several ways:
1. Dual-axis time charts: Plot current and previous period on the same timeline
2. Percent change calculation: Create calculated fields showing relative change
3. Small multiples: Display multiple time periods as separate mini-charts
4. Normalized comparison: Index values to a common starting point (100%)
5. Moving averages: Smooth out fluctuations to highlight true trends

The Period Comparison template provides a pre-built framework for this analysis. For seasonal businesses, year-over-year comparison often provides the most meaningful insights rather than sequential period comparison.
