## Frequently Asked Questions

### Distribution

**Q: How long does it take for my music to appear on streaming platforms?**  
A: After submission, your music typically takes 2-5 business days to be processed and delivered to platforms. Then platforms have their own ingestion times, usually 1-3 additional days. For optimal results, we recommend scheduling releases at least 2 weeks in advance.

**Q: Can I change my release date after submitting?**  
A: Yes, you can modify your release date through the Distribution Management interface up until 72 hours before the scheduled release. After that, changes may not be possible for technical reasons.

**Q: What happens if there's an error with my release?**  
A: If we detect any issues with your submission, you'll receive a notification with details about the problem and steps to resolve it. Common issues include incorrect metadata, low-quality audio files, or artwork that doesn't meet requirements.

### Rights & Royalties

**Q: How often are royalties calculated and paid?**  
A: Royalties are calculated monthly as we receive reports from platforms. Payments are processed once your balance reaches your selected payment threshold (default: $50) or on your configured payment schedule.

**Q: How do I handle a collaboration where I need to split royalties?**  
A: Use the Split Management tool to invite collaborators by email, set percentage splits, and have all parties electronically sign the agreement. Once established, royalties will be automatically divided according to the agreed percentages.

**Q: Can I transfer my existing catalog to TuneMantra?**  
A: Yes, you can transfer your existing catalog by using our Catalog Transfer tool. You'll need to provide proof of rights ownership and information about your current distributor. Our team will guide you through the process to ensure a smooth transition.

### Analytics & Marketing

**Q: Why do my streaming numbers differ between TuneMantra and the streaming platform's own dashboard?**  
A: Slight differences are normal due to reporting delays, data processing times, and different counting methodologies. TuneMantra consolidates data from all platforms, which may be updated at different intervals. For the most accurate historical data, always refer to TuneMantra's finalized monthly statements.

**Q: How can I increase my chances of getting on editorial playlists?**  
A: Submit your music at least 4 weeks before release through our Playlist Pitching tool. Include compelling artist and track information, noteworthy achievements, and a clear description of why your track fits specific playlists. Our data shows that consistent quality releases, growing engagement metrics, and a strong artist profile significantly improve playlist consideration.

**Q: How do I track the effectiveness of my marketing efforts?**  
A: Use our Campaign Tracking feature to create unique links and campaign tags for each marketing initiative. This allows you to directly attribute streams, followers, and revenue to specific marketing activities in your Analytics dashboard, helping you identify your most effective promotion channels.
