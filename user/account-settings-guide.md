**Q: Can I have multiple users with different permission levels for my label account?**  
A: Yes, TuneMantra supports sophisticated team management:
1. Go to Account Settings > Team Management > Team Members
2. Click "Add Team Member" and enter their email address
3. Select one of our predefined roles (Admin, Finance, A&R, Marketing, etc.) or create a custom role
4. Customize specific permissions if needed
5. Set access limitations by catalog, territory, or function if required
6. Review and confirm the invitation

The new user will receive an email invitation to join your team. You can add up to 5 team members with the Standard plan, 15 with the Professional plan, and unlimited with the Enterprise plan. Each team member can have their own login credentials while accessing your shared account resources based on their permissions.

**Q: How do I add or remove seats from my subscription?**  
A: Adjusting your subscription seats is simple:
1. Go to Account Settings > Billing & Subscription > Subscription Management
2. Click "Modify Subscription" and select "Adjust Seats"
3. Use the controls to increase or decrease your seat count
4. Review the prorated cost adjustment
5. Confirm your changes

For seat increases, you'll be charged immediately for the prorated amount through your billing period. For seat decreases, the change will take effect at your next renewal date unless you select "Apply Immediately," which will provide an account credit for unused time. Note that you cannot reduce seats below the number of active users; you'll need to remove users first.

### Security Questions

**Q: How do I enable two-factor authentication for my account?**  
A: To enhance your account security with 2FA:
1. Go to Account Settings > Security > Multi-Factor Authentication
2. Click "Enable 2FA" and select your preferred method:
   - Authenticator App (recommended)
   - SMS Text Messages
   - Email Codes
3. Follow the setup instructions for your chosen method
4. Save your backup recovery codes in a secure location
5. Verify the setup by completing a test login

Once enabled, you'll need both your password and a verification code when logging in from new devices or after 30 days on trusted devices. We strongly recommend using an authenticator app like Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, or Authy for the most secure experience, as SMS can be vulnerable to interception.

**Q: What should I do if I suspect unauthorized access to my account?**  
A: If you believe your account has been compromised:
1. Immediately go to Account Settings > Security > Emergency Actions
2. Click "Secure My Account" to initiate our security protocol:
   - This immediately logs out all active sessions
   - Temporarily suspends API access
   - Prompts an immediate password reset
   - Enables additional monitoring
2. Complete the password reset process with a strong, unique password
3. Review recent account activity in the Security Audit Log
4. Check for any unauthorized changes to payment methods, contact info, or team members
5. Enable two-factor authentication if not already active
6. Contact support for additional security review

For added protection, consider reviewing authorized applications and integrations and revoking any you don't recognize or need.

**Q: Can I restrict account access to specific IP addresses?**  
A: Yes, IP restrictions are available on Professional and Enterprise plans:
1. Go to Account Settings > Security > Access Controls
2. Select "IP Restrictions" from the security options
3. Choose your restriction mode:
   - Allowlist Mode (only specified IPs can access)
   - Denylist Mode (specified IPs are blocked)
4. Add IP addresses or CIDR ranges to your list
5. Set an emergency override contact in case of legitimate access issues
6. Enable email notifications for blocked access attempts
7. Save your configuration

Remember that IP restrictions apply to all access methods including the web interface, API access, and mobile applications. We recommend testing your configuration carefully and keeping at least one emergency contact who can disable restrictions if legitimate access is blocked. IP restrictions work alongside other security measures like 2FA for layered protection.

### Billing Questions

**Q: How do I update my payment method or billing information?**  
A: To update your payment information:
1. Navigate to Account Settings > Billing & Subscription > Payment Methods
2. To add a new method:
   - Click "Add Payment Method"
   - Enter the required details
   - Set as default if desired
3. To update an existing method:
   - Select the payment method
   - Click "Edit" or "Update"
   - Make your changes
4. To update billing information:
   - Go to the "Billing Information" tab
   - Edit company name, address, tax ID, etc.
   - Save your changes

Changes to your payment method take effect immediately. If you're removing your only payment method, you'll need to add a new one first. For subscription payments, the default payment method will be used for your next billing cycle.

**Q: What happens if I exceed my plan's usage limits?**  
A: TuneMantra handles usage overages in the following ways:
1. Notification: You'll receive alerts at 80% and 95% of your limits
2. Grace Buffer: Most limits include a 10% buffer before overage charges apply
3. Overage Handling (varies by feature):
   - Storage: Automatic charging at your plan's overage rate
   - API Calls: Rate limiting once threshold is reached
   - Distributions: Queuing of new requests until next cycle
   - Team Seats: Required upgrade before adding more users
4. Billing: Any overages appear as line items on your next invoice

You can monitor your current usage in Account Settings > Billing & Subscription > Usage Dashboard. To avoid overages, consider upgrading your plan if you consistently approach your limits. Enterprise customers can configure custom overage handling, including hard caps with no additional charges.

**Q: How do I get a copy of my invoices for accounting purposes?**  
A: All billing documentation is easily accessible:
1. Go to Account Settings > Billing & Subscription > Billing History
2. Find the invoice you need in the list
3. Click "Download" to get a PDF copy
4. For additional formats:
   - Use the "Export" button
   - Select format (PDF, CSV, or JSON)
   - Choose download or email delivery
5. For legal/tax documentation:
   - Select the "Tax Documents" tab
   - Download annual statements, VAT receipts, etc.

For automated delivery, you can configure invoice email settings or set up a webhook notification for new invoices. Enterprise customers can also arrange for automated delivery to accounting systems via SFTP or API integration.

### Integration Questions

**Q: How do I connect my Spotify for Artists account with TuneMantra?**  
A: To integrate Spotify for Artists data:
1. Go to Account Settings > Integrations > Streaming Platforms
2. Locate Spotify in the platform list and click "Connect"
3. Click "Authorize with Spotify"
4. Log in to your Spotify for Artists account when prompted
5. Review the requested permissions and click "Authorize"
6. Complete any additional verification steps requested by Spotify
7. Return to TuneMantra to confirm successful connection

Once connected, your Spotify streaming data will begin syncing to TuneMantra within 24-48 hours. Historical data for up to 36 months may be imported depending on your subscription level. You can verify the connection status and last sync time in the integration dashboard. For troubleshooting or disconnection, return to the same settings page.

**Q: Can I use the TuneMantra API to build my own custom reports or applications?**  
A: Yes, our comprehensive API enables custom integrations:
1. Go to Account Settings > API Access > API Keys
2. Click "Generate New API Key"
3. Name your key based on its purpose (e.g., "Custom Reporting Tool")
4. Select the specific scopes (permissions) required
5. Set any optional restrictions (IP limits, rate limits, expiration)
6. Create and securely store your new API credentials

Once you have your credentials, visit our Developer Portal (developers.tunemantra.com) for documentation, code examples, and SDKs in popular languages. All plans include API access, but quotas and available endpoints vary by subscription level. Remember that API keys grant access to your account, so handle them securely and rotate them periodically.

**Q: How do I set up automated data exports to my own systems?**  
A: TuneMantra offers several data export automation options:
1. Scheduled Reports:
   - Configure in Reporting > Scheduled Reports
   - Set delivery to SFTP, cloud storage, or email
   - Define frequency, format, and content

2. Webhook Notifications:
   - Configure in Account Settings > API Access > Webhooks
   - Receive real-time data on specified events
   - Process data in your own systems

3. Direct Database Connection (Enterprise only):
   - Request secure read-replica access
   - Connect your BI tools directly
   - Set up ETL processes

4. Custom API Integration:
   - Use our REST API with your authentication
   - Implement polling or event-based synchronization
   - Develop against our sandbox environment

The most popular approach is scheduled exports to a cloud storage provider (S3, GCS, Azure Blob) combined with webhook notifications for real-time updates. Enterprise customers can request customized integration solutions through their account manager.
