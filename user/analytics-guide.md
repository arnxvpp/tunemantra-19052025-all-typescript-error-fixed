## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Analytics Questions

**Q: Why do my streaming numbers differ between TuneMantra and my DSP dashboards?**  
A: Slight differences are normal due to several factors: (1) Data timing differences - TuneMantra may aggregate data at different intervals than DSPs; (2) Counting methodologies - platforms may have different definitions of a "stream"; (3) Processing delays - some platforms have longer reporting cycles. For financial reconciliation, the final monthly statements should be considered authoritative.

**Q: How far back does historical data go in TuneMantra Analytics?**  
A: TuneMantra Analytics maintains complete historical data from the moment your content is distributed through our platform. For content distributed before joining TuneMantra, we can import historical data from most major platforms during onboarding, typically up to 3 years of historical performance.

**Q: How often is analytics data updated?**  
A: Most streaming and performance data is updated daily, typically refreshing between 2-4 AM UTC. Revenue data is updated as it's reported by platforms, which varies by platform but is typically every 30-45 days. Real-time estimates are provided for revenue based on stream counts and historical averages.

### Technical Questions

**Q: Can I access raw data for custom analysis?**  
A: Yes, TuneMantra provides several options for accessing raw data: (1) The Report Builder allows detailed data export in CSV/Excel format; (2) The Analytics API provides programmatic access for custom integrations; (3) For enterprise clients, direct database connections can be established. Contact your account manager for specific requirements.

**Q: What attribution models are used for tracking marketing impact?**  
A: TuneMantra uses a multi-touch attribution model that assigns appropriate credit to various marketing touchpoints. By default, we use a position-based model that gives 40% credit to first touch, 40% to last touch, and 20% distributed among middle interactions. Enterprise users can configure custom attribution models in the Marketing Analytics settings.

**Q: How accurate is the demographic data?**  
A: Demographic data comes from several sources: (1) Platform-provided anonymous aggregate data; (2) TuneMantra audience panel data; (3) Third-party data partnerships. The accuracy varies by platform and region, with typically 90%+ confidence for major territories and platforms. All demographic data is presented as statistically significant samples, not individual listener tracking.

### Analytics Interpretation

**Q: What metrics should I focus on to measure my music's success?**  
A: The most important metrics depend on your specific goals:
- For growth focus: Track listener growth rate, new listener acquisition, and geographic expansion
- For engagement focus: Monitor save rate, completion rate, and repeat listener percentage
- For revenue focus: Analyze revenue per stream, platform revenue efficiency, and catalog value
We recommend creating a custom dashboard with your top 5-7 KPIs aligned with your current strategic objectives.

**Q: How can I identify which part of my catalog to focus on promoting?**  
A: Use the Catalog Analysis section to identify: (1) High-performing tracks with growth potential - look for tracks with strong completion rates and save rates; (2) Tracks resonating with specific audience segments - use the audience affinity analysis; (3) Tracks with playlist potential - review the playlist match score. The Opportunity Analysis tool automatically highlights tracks that merit additional promotional support.

**Q: How do I interpret sudden changes in streaming numbers?**  
A: Investigate sudden changes using these analytics tools: (1) The Source Analysis will show if changes came from playlists, algorithms, or direct traffic; (2) The Platform Breakdown will reveal if changes are platform-specific; (3) The Geography View will show if changes are region-specific. Major spikes often correlate with playlist additions, algorithm changes, or social media events - all identifiable in the respective analytics sections.
