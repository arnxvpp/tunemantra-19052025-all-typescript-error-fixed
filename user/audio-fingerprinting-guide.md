# Audio Fingerprinting User Guide

## What is Audio Fingerprinting?

Audio fingerprinting is a technology that identifies unique characteristics in audio files, similar to how a human fingerprint identifies a person. In TuneMantra, we use audio fingerprinting to:

1. **Verify originality** of your content
2. **Identify potential copyright issues** before distribution
3. **Validate metadata** accuracy
4. **Detect samples** from other works that may require clearance

## Why is Audio Fingerprinting Important?

Distributing music with copyright issues can lead to:

- Takedown notices
- Lost revenue
- Legal complications
- Damaged reputation

Our audio fingerprinting tool helps you identify these issues **before** your music is distributed, saving you time, money, and potential legal headaches.

## Using the Audio Fingerprinting Tool

### Step 1: Upload Your Audio

1. Navigate to the Upload page
2. Select your audio file(s) by clicking "Browse" or dragging files into the upload area
3. The system will first validate the file format and specifications
4. Once validation passes, proceed to the Metadata tab

### Step 2: Run the Fingerprinting Validation

In the Metadata tab, you'll see the "Copyright Validation" card with the Audio Fingerprinting tool.

1. Click the "Start Fingerprinting Validation" button
2. The system will analyze your audio for:
   - Matches in commercial music databases
   - Metadata accuracy
   - Potential samples

3. This process takes a few moments to complete

### Step 3: Review the Results

After analysis is complete, review each section of the results:

#### Copyright Detection

This section shows if your track matches existing content in commercial databases:

- **Green badge (Passed)**: No matches found - your content appears to be original
- **Red badge (Issues Found)**: Potential copyright matches detected

If matches are found, you'll see details including:
- Track title and artist
- Confidence level of the match
- Source of the match
- Potential copyright issues

#### Metadata Validation

Verifies if your provided metadata matches what was detected in the audio:

- **Green badge (Passed)**: Your metadata is consistent with the audio content
- **Red badge (Issues Found)**: Discrepancies detected between your metadata and what was found in the audio

Any issues will be clearly listed for you to address.

#### Sample Detection

Identifies potential samples from other works:

- **Green badge (No Samples)**: No samples detected
- **Red badge (Samples Found)**: Potential samples detected, with details including:
  - Original track and artist
  - Timestamp where the sample appears
  - Confidence level

## What to Do If Issues Are Found

### Copyright Matches

If your track has a high-confidence match:

1. **Verify originality**: Confirm your track doesn't improperly use copyrighted material
2. **Check for covers**: If this is a cover song, ensure you have the proper licenses
3. **Document ownership**: If it's your original work that's already in the database, be prepared to provide proof of ownership

### Metadata Discrepancies

If metadata issues are detected:

1. **Check your metadata**: Verify that your titles, artist names, and other details are accurate
2. **Update if needed**: Correct any errors in the metadata fields
3. **Add explanation**: If there's a legitimate reason for the discrepancy, note it in the additional info field

### Sample Detection

If samples are detected:

1. **Verify samples**: Confirm whether you're using samples from other works
2. **Ensure clearance**: Make sure you have proper clearance for any samples
3. **Document licenses**: Keep records of any sample clearances you've obtained

## Best Practices

1. **Run fingerprinting early**: Check for issues before completing the full distribution process
2. **Address all issues**: Resolve any identified problems before distribution
3. **Keep documentation**: Maintain records of sample clearances and rights
4. **Be thorough with metadata**: Provide complete and accurate information

## Limitations

Please note that our audio fingerprinting system:

1. May not detect **all** potential copyright issues
2. Works best with released commercial music
3. Has varying detection rates based on audio quality and length
4. Should be used as a tool, not a guarantee of copyright clearance
