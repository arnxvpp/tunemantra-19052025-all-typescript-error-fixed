## Frequently Asked Questions

### Submission & Timing

**Q: How far in advance should I submit my release?**  
A: We recommend submitting your release at least 3-4 weeks before your intended release date. This allows sufficient time for processing, delivery to all platforms, and platform ingestion. For important releases with marketing campaigns, consider submitting 6-8 weeks in advance.

**Q: Can I change my release date after submission?**  
A: Yes, you can modify your release date through the Distribution Management interface up until 7 days before the scheduled release. After that, changes may not be possible for technical reasons. Date changes may affect editorial playlist consideration.

**Q: What's the fastest possible distribution timeline?**  
A: With Priority Distribution, we can typically deliver to major platforms within 3-5 days. However, platform ingestion times vary and cannot be guaranteed. For truly urgent releases, contact support to discuss Rush Distribution options.

### Platforms & Delivery

**Q: Why is my release available on some platforms but not others?**  
A: Different platforms have varying ingestion times. Major platforms like Spotify and Apple Music typically process content within 1-7 days, while smaller or regional platforms may take 7-21 days. Check the Distribution Dashboard for platform-specific status information.

**Q: Can I select different release dates for different platforms?**  
A: Yes, with Advanced Distribution control, you can set platform-specific release dates. This allows for exclusive windows, staggered releases, or territory-based rollouts. Configure these options in the Platform Settings section during distribution setup.

**Q: How do I get my music on editorial playlists?**  
A: Editorial playlist consideration starts with timely distribution (at least 3-4 weeks before release). Use the Playlist Pitching tool in the Marketing section to create compelling pitches for editorial teams. Complete all metadata thoroughly and include engaging release notes to improve your chances.

### Troubleshooting & Updates

**Q: My release was rejected by a platform. What should I do?**  
A: Check the Distribution Dashboard for specific error details. Most rejections relate to metadata, artwork, or audio quality issues. The error message will indicate the specific problem and required corrections. Make the necessary changes and resubmit through the Resolution Center.

**Q: Can I update my release metadata or artwork after distribution?**  
A: Yes, you can update certain elements after distribution through the Catalog Management section. Metadata updates typically take 1-2 weeks to propagate across all platforms. Artwork changes are possible but may take longer and require redelivery to some platforms.

**Q: How do I remove my music from a specific platform?**  
A: In the Distribution Dashboard, locate the release and select "Manage Availability." You can then select specific platforms for takedown. Takedown requests typically process within 3-7 days, although complete removal may take up to 2-3 weeks on some platforms.
