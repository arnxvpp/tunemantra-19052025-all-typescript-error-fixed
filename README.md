## Documentation

TuneMantra provides three complementary documentation systems to meet different needs:

### 1. Directory-based Documentation

Organized documentation is available in the [documentation](documentation/README.md) directory:

- [Project Documentation](documentation/project/README.md)
- [Technical Documentation](documentation/technical/README.md)
- [User Documentation](documentation/user/README.md)
- [Developer Documentation](documentation/developer/README.md)
- [Admin Documentation](documentation/admin/README.md)
- [API Reference](documentation/reference/api/README.md)

### 2. Topic-Based Documentation (Archived)

For better performance and navigation, we've created topic-based documentation that splits the comprehensive documentation into manageable topic files. This is accessible through the [Topic Documentation Index](documentation/indexes/TOPIC_DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md). The topic files are stored in the `documentation/archive/sections/topics/` directory.

### 3. Comprehensive Documentation (Archived)

A complete historical archive is available in the [TuneMantra_Comprehensive_Documentation.md](documentation/archive/TuneMantra_Comprehensive_Documentation.md) file, stored in the archive directory. Note that this is a very large file (8.9MB) and may cause browser performance issues. A reference guide is also available in the [TuneMantra_Documentation_Reference.md](documentation/references/TuneMantra_Documentation_Reference.md) file.

### 4. Setup and Security Documentation

- **Setup Documentation**: [LOCALHOST_SETUP.md](documentation/setup/LOCALHOST_SETUP.md), [ZIP_CREATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md](documentation/setup/ZIP_CREATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md)
- **Security Updates**: [security-updates.md](documentation/security/security-updates.md)
- **Dependencies**: [dependencies.md](documentation/dependencies/dependencies.md)

### Navigation Between Systems

A [Documentation Index](documentation/DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md) provides an overview of the reorganized documentation structure. The [Master Index](documentation/indexes/MASTER_INDEX.md) is available to help navigate between all documentation systems. For more information about the documentation organization, see [Documentation Systems](documentation/metadata/DOCUMENTATION_SYSTEMS.md).

## Getting Started
